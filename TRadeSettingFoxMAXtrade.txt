Changes made to allow more trades
1. Made exhaustion and rejection optional (default: false)
Changed RequireExhaustion = false (was true)
Changed RequireRejection = false (was true)
These were blocking all trades when not detected
2. Increased tolerance for "near" key levels
Before: Fixed 15 pips
Now: Dynamic based on ATR or 0.3% of price (whichever is larger)
Allows price to be considered "near" high/low/mid more often
3. Relaxed Risk:Reward requirement
Before: Minimum 1:1 RR (too strict)
Now: Minimum 0.7:1 RR (allows more trades)
Maximum increased from 2.5 to 3.0
4. Relaxed trend filter
Before: Rejected all trades in trending markets
Now: Only logs warning, doesn't reject (allows trades in trends)
5. Enhanced logging
More detailed logs to identify which filter blocks trades
Enable EnableDetailedLog = true to see rejection reasons
Expected results
More trade opportunities (exhaustion/rejection no longer mandatory)
Better level detection (larger tolerance zone)
More flexible RR (0.7:1 minimum)
Trades allowed in trending markets
Recommendations
Enable detailed logging: Set EnableDetailedLog = true to see why trades are rejected
Consider trading all day: Set TradeAllDay = true if you want trades outside London session
Monitor performance: After backtesting, adjust filters based on results
The EA should now take trades. Run a backtest and check the logs to see which setups are being detected.
